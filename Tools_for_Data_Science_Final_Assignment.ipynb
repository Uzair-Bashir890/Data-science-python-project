## Exercise 1: Simple Arithmetic
Perform a simple arithmetic operation: multiply 3 by 4, then add 5.

# Multiply 3 by 4, then add 5
result = (3*4) + 5
result 17

## Exercise 2: Convert Minutes to Hours
Convert 200 minutes into hours and display as a decimal.

# Convert 200 minutes into hours
hours = 200 / 60
hours   3.3333333333333335
round(200 / 60, 2)
3.33
